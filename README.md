## Pigtails: Owned Assets

### This is a Sketch Library that contains tools, resources, and best practices for designing web banners, emails, iOS/Android push notifications, and presentation decks for Wendy's.

#### Using the library

1. Create a [Sketch Cloud account](https://sketch.cloud/signup) (<- open that in a new tab)
2. Request access to the [Pigtails Owned Assets UI library](https://sketch.cloud/s/0A5Ve)
3. Choose `Add Library to Sketch` from the dropdown on the page. Gif demo below for where that's at.

4. That's it! You can either use the file as a library to pull assets from (method described above) OR use the other option in that dropdown and download the [whole Sketch file](https://sketch.cloud/s/0A5Ve) and use it as a boilerplate for your project (recommended for fastest method to create banners and emails with linked product imagery)


#### Best Practices

* Exporting assets for email development varies by project, so work with your developer on file types and size, but generally speaking we should: 
	* Export images @1x
	* Keep file size under 200k
	* Avoid exporting typography as an image at all costs
	
* So you have to convert your Sketch file to a PSD for a local market
	* Use [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), but it only works for the first 30 minutes of the hour, every hour. Unless we have to do this often then we'll start paying for an account


#### Future Plans 
* Combine with our larger wendy's design library to create a comprehensive repo
* Evolve and iterate based on feedback
